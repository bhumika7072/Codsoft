          HTML calculator is used for performing basic mathematical operations like Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.As we know, the Calculator 
is a portable device used in our daily life to perform various mathematical functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, root, etc. However, 
we have scientific or sophisticated calculators used to solve complex tasks such as trigonometry functions, degrees, exponential operators, log functions, 
hyperbolic functions, square root, and so on. In this topic, we will create a calculator program in JavaScript.

This is used to construct Calculator:

1. A grid of numbers (0-9 and 00).
2. Some basic athematic operators (+, -, /, x, %).
3. And some symbols for special operations such as (clear, backspace, equal).

Steps for Creating a Calculator in HTML CSS & JavaScript:
To create a working calculator HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, follow the given steps line by line:

1. Create a folder. You can name this folder whatever you want, and inside this folder, create the mentioned files.
2. Create an index.html file. The file name must be index and its extension .html
3. Create a style.css file. The file name must be style and its extension .css
4. Create a script.js file. The file name must be script and its extension .js
